Personally I like the straigtforwardness of the track, you complete one topic & solve all important questions then you automatically get motivated to move to next milestone. It's like treasure for a student like me who doesn't have coding environment in college. I can't explain my gratitude towards whole GCI team. Initially, I wasn't able to solve easy problems but with time I learnt to stick with problem longer and finally solve it. I have a lot to say but.... I would like to thank GCI team from bottom of my heart. To be honest I feel very lucky that I got to know about GCI :)"

They also keep us updated with the new opportunities through WhatsApp groups and Linkedin. I think I couldn't have achieved this much without being a part of this society. Thank you so much for this great initiative."

I give all the credits to the entire GCI team for building this community where all doubts are solved, especially Manvi Di, who asked me not to give up bcz I thought I was dumb and wasn't good enough. Just one chat with her gave me a boost. I won't say I achieved a lot, but for those who believed this field wasn't for them, to them imagining a career in it has been a long, confusing & beautiful journey. I look fwd to learn more & improve a lot. Please never stop guiding and helping us! Loads of love."
